# Hello World

I started this github before i started high-school.  
Since then:
- The amount of code i write has increased substantially
- The quality of code i write has increased marginally
- The amount of swearing in my commit logs has stayed the same

I have mainly transitioned into using a tech stack of:
- ~~F# for functional math-heavy stuff(mainly uni calculations)~~
- Haskell for functional stuff, and some hobby language development
- Python for scripting and for backend development
- C for something i need to go really fast(gonna learn rust at some point)
- Javascript for writing visually appealing visualizations and graphics demos

## Boring ass todo
If you're cyberstalking me for a job/project, here is my plan for the next couple of years
- [x] Get the fuck out of high school
- [x] Start studying CompSci(datalogi) at Copenhagen university
- [x] Get my Bsc. degree in 2021
- [ ] Get my Masters degree in 2023
- [ ] Get a job and work full-time again
- [ ] Become the greatest systems architect the world has ever known
